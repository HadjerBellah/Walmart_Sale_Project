# Walmart Data Analysis:

## Project Overview

![Project Pipeline](https://github.com/.......


This project is an end-to-end data analysis solution designed to extract critical business insights from Walmart sales data. We utilize Python for data processing and analysis, SQL for advanced querying, and structured problem-solving techniques to solve key business questions. The project is ideal for data analysts looking to develop skills in data manipulation, SQL querying, and data pipeline creation.

## Project Steps

### 1. Set Up the Environment
   - **Tools Used**: Jupyter Notebook (run through browser), Python (for all code and analysis)
   - **Goal**: The goal of this project is to create a well-structured workspace for analyzing Walmart sales data using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The project is organized into clear folders to separate data, notebooks, and outputs, making the workflow smooth and the project easy to maintain, share, and extend.

### 2. Set Up Kaggle API
   - **API Setup**: Obtain your Kaggle API token from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) by navigating to your profile settings and downloading the JSON file.
   - **Configure Kaggle**: 
      - Place the downloaded `kaggle.json` file in your local `.kaggle` folder.
      - Use the command `kaggle datasets download -d <dataset-path>` to pull datasets directly into your project.

### 3. Download Walmart Sales Data
   - **Data Source**: Use the Kaggle API to download the Walmart sales datasets from Kaggle.
   - **Dataset Link**: [Walmart Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/najir0123/walmart-10k-sales-datasets)
   - **Storage**: Save the data in the `data/` folder for easy reference and access.

### 4. Install Required Libraries and Load Data
   - **Libraries**: Install necessary Python libraries using:
     ```bash
     pip install pandas numpy sqlalchemy mysql-connector-python psycopg2
     ```
   - **Loading Data**: Read the data into a Pandas DataFrame for initial analysis and transformations.

### 5. Explore the Data
   - **Goal**: Conduct an initial data exploration to understand data distribution, check column names, types, and identify potential issues.
   - **Analysis**: Use functions like `.info()`, `.describe()`, and `.head()` to get a quick overview of the data structure and statistics.

### 6. Data Cleaning before analysis using Python or R (me here it was python)
   - **Remove Duplicates**: Identify and remove duplicate entries to avoid skewed results.
   - **Handle Missing Values**: Drop rows or columns with missing values if they are insignificant; fill values where essential.
  ## Decide What to Do About Them ## There are 3 main options:
 A. Drop Missing Values:  Drop rows with any missing values:
B. Fill Missing Values
C. Visualize or Flag Them (Optional)
 Tip: Don't blindly drop all missing values! Use dropna() only if:
-- The missing data is minimal
-- The rows are not critical to your analysis
-- Use fillna() when: You want to keep the data or You're working with numerical columns that affect analysis 
   - **Fix Data Types**: Ensure all columns have consistent data types (e.g., dates as `datetime`, prices as `float`).
   - **Currency Formatting**: Use `.replace()` to handle and format currency values for analysis.
   - **Validation**: Check for any remaining inconsistencies and verify the cleaned data.

### 7. Load Data into Python using Pandas
   - **Set Up Environment**: Launch Jupyter Notebook and import necessary Python libraries like `pandas`.
   - **Load Data**: Read the cleaned dataset into a Pandas DataFrame from a local file (e.g., CSV, Excel).
   - **Verification**: Preview the data by displaying shape, column names, and the first few rows to confirm it loaded correctly.

### 8. Data Analysis: Business Problem Solving with Pandas
   - **Business Problem-Solving**: Use Pandas and visualization libraries to answer key business questions, such as:
     - Revenue trends across branches and product categories.
     - Identifying best-selling product categories.
     - Sales performance over time, by city, and payment method.
     - Analyzing peak sales periods and customer buying behavior.
     - Profit margin analysis by branch and category.
   - **Documentation**: Provide clear Markdown cells explaining each analysis step, including the question, method, and conclusion.

###9.
   - **Documentation**: Maintain clear and well-organized documentation using Markdown cells within Jupyter Notebooks and a comprehensive `README.md` file.
   - **Project Publishing**: Publish the final project on GitHub (or any version control platform), including:
     - The `README.md` file (this document).
     - All Jupyter Notebooks used throughout the project.
     - Any relevant data files (if shareable), or clear instructions on how to access them.
     - Python scripts (if any) for automation or reusable components.

## Results and Insights

This section will include your analysis findings:
- **Sales Insights**: Key categories, branches with highest sales, and preferred payment methods.
- **Profitability**: Insights into the most profitable product categories and locations.
- **Customer Behavior**: Trends in ratings, payment preferences, and peak shopping hours.

## Future Enhancements

Possible extensions to this project:
- Interactive Dashboards:Integrate with visualization tools like Power BI, Tableau, or Plotly Dash to create interactive dashboards that allow users to explore the data dynamically.
- Incorporate Additional Data Sources: Add more datasets (e.g., from APIs, other databases, or external files) to deepen the analysis and provide more comprehensive insights.
- Automate Data Pipeline: Develop scripts or use tools (e.g., Airflow, Prefect) to automate data downloading, cleaning, and loading, enabling scheduled or real-time updates.
- Deploy as Web Application: Package the analysis and visualization into a web app (using Streamlit or Flask) to make it accessible to non-technical stakeholders.
- Enhance Data Cleaning and Validation: Improve preprocessing steps with more robust error handling and validation checks to ensure data quality.
